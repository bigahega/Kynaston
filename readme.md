# Kynaston
Kynaston is a replicated in-memory Key-Value store featuring checkpointing approach. For now,
it only supports primary-backup replication and chain replication is on its way already. It also
includes various checkpointing algorithms such as full, incremental, differential, compressed and
periodic flavors of those.
## Usage
Each replica has to be run on its own server. Further instructions will be added shortly.
## Contributing
For now, the project is not open for any contribution when its in Alpha stage.
